77;Function;"Regulates genomic imprinting of a cluster of autosomal genes (Igf2r, Slc22a2 and Slc22a3) in cis, on mouse chromosome 17 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11845212"">Sleutels (2002)</a>).  

Truncation of Air disrupts imprinting not only of Igf2r but also the nearby non-overlapping genes Slc22a2 and Slc22a3, leading to mice with a lower birth weight (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11845212"">Sleutels (2002)</a>).

Air RNA forms a ""cloud"" over the imprinted DNA locus, binding to chromatin. Recruits G9a histone methyltransferase to epigenetically silence Slc22a3 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18988810"">Nagano (2008)</a>). Igf2r is not silenced by this mechanism.

Nb: Slc22a3 and Slc22a2 are only imprinted at a specific time point in placental development. Outside of this time point the Air ""cloud""/ Air chromatin binding and repressive histone modification are not found on these gene loci (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18988810"">Nagano (2008)</a>).

Expressed in glial cells of the developing brain but not in neurons, explains lack of Igf2r imprinting in these neurons. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16037066"">Yamasaki (2005)</a>)

Traverses a noncoding region centromeric to CDKN2A, a region containing the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus and implicated in a range of complex diseases including cancer (such as melanoma-neural system tumor syndrome), type 2 diabetes, periodontitis and coronary heart disease (see extensive reference list in Literature below, and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20716961"">Popov (2010)</a> for a review).

79;Expression;"Expressed in tissues and cell types affected by atherosclerosis. Increased levels of ANRIL are found in patients carrying the atherosclerosis risk haplotype expression, including in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whole blood and atherosclerotic plaque tissue, and the levels were directly correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20056914"">Holdt (2010)</a>). 

Up-regulated in prostate cancer (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20541999"">Yap (2010)</a>).";2
79;Function;"In vitro over-expression of p15as/ANRIL RNA was originally demonstrated to induce epigenetic silencing of p15 gene expression (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18185590"">Yu (2008)</a>).

Recently, ANRIL RNA was found to interact and regulate chromobox 7 (CBX7), a component of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1), which methylates histone H3 lysine 27 to promote epigenetic silencing, and is also up-regulated in prostate cancer. Interaction occurs with a conserved chromodomain of CBX7 and is essential for the ability of PRC1 to repress the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus and control cell senescence.

81;Characteristics;"~2 kb; two splice variants were identified for human and mouse BACE1-AS. Transcribed  from an intron of the beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) gene in antisense direction it also completely overlapps exon 6 of BACE-1 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408"">Faghihi (2008)</a>).";1
81;Expression;"BACE1 and BACE1AS are co-expressed in a wide range of tissues and cell lines in mice and humans. BACE1 mRNA expression levels are higher than BACE1-AS levels across all tissues examined, except in Alzheimer's disease (AD) where, in contrast, BACE1-AS is expressed at a higher level in brain. Bace1 and Bace1-AS transcripts are also observed in various regions of the mouse brain (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408"">Faghihi (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507594"">Faghihi (2010)</a>).

Several cell stressors, such as high temperature, serum starvation, amyloid-beta 1-42, H2O2 and high glucose, specifically increase BACE1-AS RNA and BACE1 protein levels (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408"">Faghihi (2008)</a>).

Showed increased expression in sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) muscle fibers (possibly caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress). Nevertheless, unlike in AD and AD-transgenic mouse brain samples in which BACE1-AS transcript was increased more than the sense BACE1 transcript , in s-IBM muscle biopsies the reversed was found (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236612"">Nogalska (2010)</a>).

Mouse RNA stability was very close to median for lncRNAs, with a half-life 3.6 hr in N2A (neuroblastoma) cells (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406755"">Clark (2012)</a>). ";2
81;Function;"BACE1AS expression is elevated in Alzheimers disease (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408"">Faghihi (2008)</a>). It was shown to regulate BACE1 mRNA and protein expression in vitro and in vivo ie: over-expression, shRNA and siRNA knockdown of BACE1AS affected BACE1 expression, influencing amyloid-beta 1-42 levels (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408"">Faghihi (2008)</a>).

It was proposed that BACE1-AS and BACE1 form an RNA duplex and this increases the stability of BACE1 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587408"">Faghihi (2008)</a>). More recently, it was suggested that BACE1AS may prevent translational repression of BACE1 mRNA by miR-485-5p via masking the binding site for the microRNA. Supporting this hypothesis, BACE1AS over-expression prevented miRNA-induced suppression (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507594"">Faghihi (2010)</a>). Expression of BACE1-AS as well as miR-485-5p are dysregulated in RNA samples from Alzheimer's disease subjects compared to control individuals (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507594"">Faghihi (2010)</a>). 

BACE1-AS may also be involved in sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM), whose muscle-fiber phenotype shares molecular similarities with Alzheimer-disease brain (including increased BACE1 protein). BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts are significantly increased in s-IBM, and experimental induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress increased both BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts. These results suggest that ER stress and increased BACE1-AS expression may be involved in s-IBM (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236612"">Nogalska (2010)</a>).";3

89;Characteristics;"DHFR upstream transcripts initiate from an upstream minor promoter of the DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) gene and extend from approximately 400 nucleotide upstream of the 5'-untranslated region of DHFR (which corresponds to DHFR major/core promoter), to the second intron of the DHFR gene where they terminate (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859520"">Masters (1985)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763"">Martianov (2007)</a>). Therefore, the region located between minor and major transcript initiation sites (~400 bp) corresponds to a noncoding transcript and is a promoter of DHFR.

Discrete DHRF upstream initiating transcripts of diverse sizes have been reported, including five major discrete species with sizes of 4.3, 3.8, 3.1, 2.1, and 1.0 kb and four minor ones with sizes of 7.3, 5.0, 1.4, and 0.8kb. Primarily in the poly(A)+ fraction (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859520"">Masters (1985)</a>).

DHFR upstream transcripts adopt a series of structures in vitro that are dependent on the G-tract encompassed in its sequence (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786"">Blume (2003)</a>).";1
89;Expression;"Enriched in the nucleus (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859520"">Masters (1985)</a>).

At least six minor 5' ends mapping upstream of the DHFR gene correspond to approximately 1% of the DHFR-specific polysomal polyA RNA. Most of these species have been found in 6A3 cells, VA2-B cells (the parental line of 6A3), and in HeLa cells (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2859520"">Masters (1985)</a>).

DHFR upstream transcripts accumulate in a population of serum-starved, contact-inhibited (quiescent) U2OS cells, in which the levels of DHFR mRNA are markedly reduced (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763"">Martianov (2007)</a>).";2
89;Function;"Initial studies indicated that DHFR upstream transcripts could impair the formation of the preinitiation complex (PIC) on the major promoter in vitro, thereby repressing the transcriptional activity of the major DHFR promoter (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786"">Blume (2003)</a>). DHFR upstream transcripts were shown to inhibit transcription from the DHFR core promoter in-trans in a concentration-dependent manner in in-vitro runoff transcription assays. Transcription factor binding sites positioned between the minor and major promoters within the DHFR gene were indicated to be affected by the upstream regulatory transcripts, which selectively sequestered transcription factor Sp3, and to a lesser extent Sp1, preventing their binding to the DHRF core promoter. The sequestration of Sp3 and Sp1 by the DHFR upstream transcripts appears to involve an altered conformation of the RNA, and a structural domain of the protein distinct from that required for binding DNA (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786"">Blume (2003)</a>). However, in-vitro experiments confirmed that transcription from the major promoter could be suppressed in-trans in the absence of Sp1 or any other upstream activating sequence (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7566158"">Akoulitchev (1995)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763"">Martianov (2007)</a>).

A more recent study demonstrated that these promoter associated transcripts act as interfering transcripts, directly interacting with TFIIB and dissociate the PIC efficiently to repress DHFR expression (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763"">Martianov (2007)</a>). Transcription of the regulatory RNA in trans has a repressive effect on the major DHFR promoter only when the transcript contained the sequence of the core major DHFR promoter (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763"">Martianov (2007)</a>). In addition, the major DHFR promoter is GC-rich and contains several G-track sequences (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786"">Blume (2003)</a>), and specific and stable triplex structures have been shown to form between the DHFR upstream transcripts and the major promoter, which may contribute to promoter targeting and repression in vivo (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763"">Martianov (2007)</a>) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12461786"">Blume (2003)</a>).

A comparison of in-vitro transcription from templates containing DHFR minor, major or both promoters in their original sequential order indicated very low transcriptional activity when the minor promoter preceded the major one, but robust transcription from the major promoter, suggesting that transcriptional interference in-cis may also play a role in DHFR inhibition by DHFR upstream transcripts (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763"">Martianov (2007)</a>).";3
89;Misc;"Unpublished analysis of the epigenetic effects of DHFR upstream transcripts indicated similarities to epigenetic markers associated with transcriptional gene silencing induced by the targeted application of synthetic antigene RNAs complementary to the promoter regions of mammalian genes (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17237763"">Martianov (2007)</a>).

DHFR is the major target of methotrexate, a key component in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. DNA variations of major promoter/noncoding transcript region and specifc haplotype subtypes involving this region have been associated with childhood ALL, including associations with high-risk patients and lower event-free survival. One particular haplotype (Haplotype *1b) is associated with higher DHFR expression (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19861437"">Al-Shakfa (2009)</a>).";5
90;Characteristics;"~3.8 kb. Antisense to Dlx6 genes in the Dlx5/6 cluster. Evf1 and 2 are isoforms with alternative promoters expressed from ultraconserved enhancers. Different Evf-1 and Evf-2 transcripts result from alternative transcription initiation, alternative splicing of exon 3, and alternative polyadenylation.

Brain expression of Evf2 and Evf1 is dependent on Dlx1/2 function. Expression of Evf2 and Evf1 is also greatly reduced in Dlx5/6, and Dlx5 or Dlx6, knock-out mutants, indicating that they may be their direct or indirect regulatory targets (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15183307"">Kohtz (2004)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18697905"">Jeong (2008)</a>).

Evf2 recruitment of DLX2 and MECP2 controls the expression of targets Dlx5, Dlx6 and Gad1 through trans and cis-acting mechanisms in developing ventral forebrain.

90;Conservation;"Evf-2 is transcribed from (and contains in its first exon) a vertebrate ultraconserved element.

Evf-1 and Evf-2 exhibit a high degree (86%–93%) of conservation between rat and mouse sequences in their 5' and 3' regions, and a compilation of transcripts found in human, rat, mouse, zebrafish, and chicken shows that only transcription from exon 2 is conserved (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16705037"">Feng (2006)</a>).";4

In some cell lines certain Gas5 isoforms act to sensitise the cells to apoptosis but can't induce apoptosis on their own. In other cells types Gas5 can both induce apoptosis and growth arrest and sensitise the cells to further apoptosis (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18836484"">Mourtada-Maarabouni (2009)</a>).

Gas5 can be regulated by mTOR, with mTOR (which promotes cellular proliferation) acting to inhibit the function of Gas5 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20421347"">Mourtada-Maarabouni (2010)</a>).

Gas5 carries out its function by binding the DNA binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with a sequence that mimmics the glucocorticoid response element (GRE). Gas5 is translocated into the nucleus bound to the GR where it prevents GR from binding GREs and regulating transcription of target genes including apoptosis inhibitors (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551"">Kino (2010)</a>).

Gas5 also appears to repress the action of many steroid hormone receptors, showing some similarities to another lncRNA SRA (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551"">Kino (2010)</a>).

Gas5 is a snoRNA host and a functional RNA. Function does not require putative but nonconserved ORF, or the intronic snoRNAs (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18354083"">Mourtada-Maarabouni (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18836484"">Mourtada-Maarabouni (2009)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551"">Kino (2010)</a>).";3
92;Conservation;"Gas5 in mouse and human do not show high sequence identity (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17468437"">Tanaka-Fujita (2007)</a>) although the GRE mimmic region is conserved (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124551"">Kino (2010)</a>).

Most of the snoRNAs found in human Gas5 also cluster in the same order in a putatively noncoding RNA host gene in chicken. 42% homology was found between human Gas5 and the chicken gene which was named Gas5-like (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19232134"">Shao (2009)</a>).";4
92;Misc;"Mourtada-Maarabouni., et al (2010) provide an interesting hypothesis for how Gas5 levels and therefore function is regulated.
- Gas5 is stabilised by inhibition of protein synthesis suggesting it may normally be a target for nonsense mediated decay (NMD). mTOR regulates 5' TOP genes (which includes Gas5) promoting translation, whereas mTOR inhibition inhibits translation. This could allow mTOR to inhibit Gas5 by promoting Gas5 NMD. 

This suggests that since Gas5 is known to be functional at the RNA level, any Gas5 translation may be a regulatory to control Gas5 levels and not necessarily to produce a functional protein.  ";5

Post transcriptional processing of Malat1 therefore allows two ncRNAs to be created from the one original transcript (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041754"">Wilusz (2008)</a>).";2

Malat1 is highly expressed in the brain. RNA fluorescence in-situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) on adult mouse brain sections showed high expression of nuclear-localized Malat1 transcripts in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and neurons of the substantia nigra and motoneurons, but very low levels in non-neuronal cells (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808"">Bernard (2010)</a>). In the hippocampus and in Purkinje cells, Malat1 was first detected between post-natal day 0 (P0) and P7 and its level increased until P28 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808"">Bernard (2010)</a>). This high expression appears to come from up-regulation of Malat1 during differentiation, with in-vitro differentiation of neural stem cells showing significant up-regulation of expression in neuronal and glial differentiated progeny (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20137068"">Mercer (2010)</a>).

Malat1 co-localises with pre-mRNA-splicing factor SF2/ASF and CC3 antigen in the nuclear speckles (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808"">Bernard (2010)</a>).

MALAT1 is enriched in nuclear speckles in interphase cells and concentrates in mitotic interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs, structural analogs of nuclear speckles present in mitotic cells), but unlike Neat1 it is not required for the structural integrity of the nuclear domain (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886"">Tripathi (2010)</a>).

93;Function;"Summary: Malat1 has been found to regulate alternative splicing of endogenous target genes, and it is implicated in cancer and a series of molecular and cellular phenotypes, as indicated below.


Identified as an oncogene that promotes tumorigensis. Expression of a Malat1 fragment in NIH 3T3 cells transformed cells (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619"">Li (2009)</a>). 

Knockdown inhibited cell mobility and lead to decreased expression of several genes (CTHRC1, CCT4, HMMR, or ROD1) that promoted cell migration (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20937273"">Tano (2010)</a>). This result may also explain why knockdown inhibited trophoblast-like cell invasion in-vitro, with MALAT1 hypothesised to regulate the level of trophoblast invasion into the uterus in vivo (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690017"">Tseng (2009)</a>).

MALAT1 depletion resulted in aberrant mitosis, with a large fraction of cells accumulating at G2/M boundary, and increased cell death (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886"">Tripathi (2010)</a>).

Depletion of Malat1 in neuroblastoma cells indicated that Malat1 affects the expression of genes involved not only in the organization and the function of the nucleus, but also in synapse function and dendrite development. In cultured hippocampal neurons, knock-down of Malat1 decreased synaptic density, whereas its over-expression resulted in a cell-autonomous increase in synaptogenesis (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808"">Bernard (2010)</a>).

There is a significant enrichment for SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) binding sites within the 5' half of both human and mouse MALAT1, whose direct interaction has been demonstrated, and is dependent on its canonical RRM (RRM1) or the pseudo RRM (RRM2) domains (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19116412"">Sanford (2009)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886"">Tripathi (2010)</a>). Independent sequence elements in MALAT1 influence its distribution to nuclear speckles and the recruitment of SRSF1 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886"">Tripathi (2010)</a>).

Additional interactions have been found between MALAT1 and SRSF1, SRSF2, and SRSF3 proteins, but only weak interactions with SRSF5 and PSP1 (an RNA-binding protein that is a component of paraspeckles) have been identified (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886"">Tripathi (2010)</a>).

Knock-down of nuclear Malat1 in a transfected U2OS cell line showed that it modulates the recruitment of SR proteins (SRSF1 or SF2/ASF and SC35) to a transcriptionally active transgene array (stably integrated), indicating a role in the regulation of the association of pre-mRNA-splicing factors to transcription sites and control of post-transcriptional gene expression (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808"">Bernard (2010)</a>). Malat1 modulates the speckle association of a subset of pre-mRNA splicing factors, such as SF1, U2AF-65, SF3a60, and B-U2snRNP (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886"">Tripathi (2010)</a>).

Malat1-depleted HeLa cells show increased cellular levels of dephosphorylated SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729808"">Bernard (2010)</a>), as well as a moderately increased cytoplasmic pool of poly(A)+ RNA (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886"">Tripathi (2010)</a>). It has recently been shown to regulate alternative splicing of endogenous target genes by modulating SR splicing factor phosphorylation, affecting their levels and the distribution and ratio of phosphorylated to dephosphorylated pools (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20797886"">Tripathi (2010)</a>).

In mice, H19 is activated in extra-embryonic cell types at the time of implantation. Strongly expressed during embryogenesis, down-regulated after birth with strong expression only retained in skeletal muscle and cartilage (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6206499"">Pachnis (1984)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3396539"">Pachnis (1988)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1811930"">Poirier (1991)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668672"">Castle (2010)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20529846"">Dudek (2010)</a>); upregulated in various tumors (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17786216"">Matouk (2007)</a>).

96;Function;"Complex functions: 

Influences growth via control of Igf2 expression, with a H19 knockout showing an overgrowth phenotype due in part to bi-allelic expression of Igf2 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9203585"">Ripoche (1997)</a>).

Can also function in trans to downregulate the expression of a number of imprinted genes in the hypothesised Imprinted Gene Network (IGN) including Igf2r, Dlk1 etc. Allowing H19 to regulate growth during development (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19762426"">Gabory (2009)</a>).

Implicated as both a tumor suppressor (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7692308"">Hao (1993)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18719115"">Yoshimizu (2008)</a>) and an oncogene upregulated by c-myc and hypoxia (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17786216"">Matouk (2007)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16707459"">Barsyte-Lovejoy (2006)</a> and references therein). A number of reports have also shown upregulation / reactivation of H19 in various cancers although the functional significance (if any) is unclear in many cases (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20486133"">Gabory (2010)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9811352"">Adriaenssens (1998)</a>).


The mode of action by which H19 functions is still unclear: 

Focusing on its regulation of Igf2, H19 has been hypothesised to act at the level of transcription since an H19 knockout lead to methylation changes and loss of imprinting of Igf2 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9203585"">Ripoche (1997)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9294195"">Forné (1997)</a>). However, H19 can bind Igf2 mRNA binding-protein (IMP) family members (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10875929"">Runge (2000)</a>), which appear to act to promote translation of Igf2 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15121863"">Hansen (2004)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15753088"">Liao (2005)</a>), therefore competition between Igf2 and H19 for IMP1 binding may allow H19 to regulate Igf2 post-transcriptionally.

Both sense and antisense transcripts from the H19 locus were identified as binding to the PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting a potential function for H19 RNA (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659"">Zhao (2010)</a>).

miR-675 may be responsible for the oncogenic activity of H19 as it was found to down-regulate the tumour suppressor retinoblastoma (RB) in human colorectal cancer, causing increased tumour cell growth (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19926638"">Tsang (2010)</a>). Also, in adult human chondrocytes, expression of H19 (and subsequently miR-675) is driven by SOX9 with miR-675 acting to positively regulate COL2A1 which encodes a collagen protein important to the cartilage matrix (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20529846"">Dudek (2010)</a>).


H19 appears to be a bi-functional RNA acting as both a miRNA and a lncRNA. Such properties may help to explain the conflicting reports that it is both a tumour suppressor and an oncogene (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18587395"">Smits (2008)</a>). Additionally its effect on tumour development may be heavily context dependent (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20486133"">Gabory (2010)</a>). ";3

HOTAIR dysregulated in breast cancer with frequent overexpression in metastases. 
Overexpression of HOTAIR leads to PRC2 re-targeting across the genome to a state similar to that in embryonic fibroblasts, promoting tumour invasion and metatasis.  Oncogenic effects of HOTAIR upregulation were dependent on PRC2 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20393566"">Gupta (2010)</a>).

Deletion of the HoxC cluster containing the cognate Hotair transcript in mouse showed little phenotypic effect, with little change in the expression on levels of H3K27me3 coverage in corresponding human HOTAIR Hoxd target genes (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21637793"">Schorderet (2011)</a>).";4

101;Function;"Summary: Kcnq1ot1 has a role in the organization of a tissue/lineage-specific nuclear domain involved in epigenetic silencing of the Kcnq1 imprinting control region.


Genes imprinted by kcnq1ot1 include Kcnq1, Cdkn1c, Slc22a18 and Phlda2, which are ubiquitously imprinted and Cd81, Osbpl5, Tssc4, Tspan32 and Ascl2, which are only imprinted in placenta (reviewed in <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345374"">Kanduri (2011)</a>. An expansion of the Kncq1ot1 imprinted domain to include splice variants of Th and Ins2 was recently described (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21576366"">Jones (2011)</a>). 

Kcnq1ot1 silences genes by coating chromatin and recruiting repressive chromatin remodeling complexes such as G9a, PRC1 and PRC2 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18848501"">Terranova (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18951091"">Pandey (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15516932"">Umlauf (2004)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659"">Zhao (2010)</a>) .

Kcnq1ot1 transcript has a modular structure, the silencing element (that mediates the epigenetic silencing and directs the imprinted locus to a heterochromatin environment in the perinucleolar region) appears to be a short <1kb conserved sequence near the 5' of the transcript (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299392"">Mohammad (2008)</a>).

Kcnq1ot1 forms a silenced subdomain (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18848501"">Terranova (2008)</a>)(<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19144718"">Redrup (2009)</a>) commonly localised to the perinucleolar region during S phase (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18299392"">Mohammad (2008)</a>). The silenced subdomain may be important to the maintenance of transcriptional repression.

Kcnq1ot1 interacts with Dnmt1 and recruits it to somatically acquired differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573698"">Mohammad (2010)</a>).

In vivo knockout study shows that paternal inheritance of a deletion encompassing an 890-bp (Delta890) silencing domain downstream of the Kcnq1ot1 promoter leads reduced interaction with DNMT1 and to selective incomplete relaxation of the imprinting of imprinted genes in a tissue-specific manner (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573698"">Mohammad (2010)</a>).

Delta890 showed altered DNA methylation at somatically acquired DMRs but not in histone modifications of the ubiquitously imprinted genes. Thus, it has been proposed that the ubiquitous and placental-specific imprinting of genes within the Kcnq1 domain might be mediated by distinct mechanisms, and Kcnq1ot1 RNA might mediate the silencing of ubiquitously imprinted genes by maintaining allele-specific methylation through its interactions with Dnmt1 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573698"">Mohammad (2010)</a>).";3

104;Function;"<b>Summary:</b> Meg3 is important for proper growth and development and is a putative tumour suppressor which functions to activate p53 and inhibit cell proliferation. Meg3 can also control gene expression at imprinted loci through recruitment of the PRC2 complex. 

<b>Function in Cancer:</b>
Expression of the Meg3a splicing isoform was silenced in pituitary tumours and ectopic expression was found to inhibit growth in human cancer cells, leading to the proposition that Meg3 RNA acts as a growth suppressor (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14602737"">Zhang (2003)</a>).

Silencing of Meg3 is associated with meningioma pathogenesis and progression while ectopic expression inhibited growth and stimulated p53 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20179190"">Zhang (2010)</a>).

Meg3 knock-out increased expression of VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) signaling pathway genes in the brain, suggesting the RNA has a role in the control of vascularization, and therefore may function as a tumor suppressor in part by inhibiting angiogenesis (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20392836"">Gordon (2010)</a>).


<b>Mechanism of action:</b>
Meg3 stimulates p53 expression and can also inhibit cell proliferation/ DNA synthesis in the absence of p53 suggesting these functions are independent of each other (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17569660"">Zhou (2007)</a>), <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032057"">Zhang (2010)</a>. Meg3 contains several predicted secondary structural elements common to all isoforms. Replacement of the motif most important in p53 activation with a different sequence that formed the same structure maintained Meg3 function showing the RNA structural motifs are critical to Meg3 function (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20032057"">Zhang (2010)</a>). 

Meg3 binds the PRC2 chromatin modification complex in mouse embryonic stem cells.  Binding appears to be mediated by the 5’ 1kb of the RNA (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659"">Zhao (2010)</a>).

Controls expression of Dlk1 at the Dlk1-Meg3 imprinted locus, likely by recruiting PRC2 to the Dlk1 locus in cis. Knockdown lead to increased expression of Dlk1 and Gtl2-as along with a decrease in Ezh2/PRC2 recruitment to and H3K27me3 marks at the Dlk1 promoter (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659"">Zhao (2010)</a>).


<b>Developmental phenotypes:</b>
Knockout of Meg3 and the Meg3 differentially methylated region (DMR) on the maternal allele lead to post-birth lethality, while paternal knockout lead to increased pre and post-birth lethality and growth retardation. However other lncRNAs (Rian, Meg9) were also down-regulated, perhaps due to the loss of the DMR, making attribution of the phenotype to specific lncRNAs difficult (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19264764"">Takahashi (2009)</a>). A potentially more specific lacZ gene trap insertion gave a parent of origin dwarfism phenotype (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9626496"">Schuster-Gossler (1998)</a>).

Aberrant repression of Meg3 and other maternally expressed lncRNAs from the DLK1-Dio3 imprinting cluster is present in most induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and is responsible for the failure of iPSCs to form viable mice (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418860"">Stadtfeld (2010)</a>).

108;Function;"Identified in a shRNA knock down screening for conserved long noncoding RNAs that modulate the activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).

Knockdown of human or mouse NRON sequences in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells or mouse 3T3 and Jurkat cell lines resulted in significantly increased NFAT activity.

Knockdown of NRON increases NFAT transcription factor activity by specifically affecting NFAT nuclear trafficking. This effect is observed on the activity of multiple NFAT family members (NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, and NFATc4).

Using an RNA-protein affinity purification strategy with part of NRON sequence, 11 proteins were reported to putatively bind NRON. These included: calmodulin-binding protein (IQGAP1), a nuclear transport factor (KPNB1), the structural subunit of a phosphatase (PPP2R1A), a component of the proteasome (PSMD11) and an RNA helicase (DDX3X); as well as three members of the importin-beta superfamily, factors which mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of cargoes such as NFAT. Direct interaction was demonstrated with importin-beta 1 (KPNB1).

In summary, having a repressive effect on NFAT signaling, NRON is proposed to regulate NFAT's subcellular localization as an RNA component of a protein complex that acts to represses NFAT activity.

Telomere length correlates with TERRA levels in immortal cell lines.

TERRA siRNA knock-down caused an increase in telomere dysfunction-induced foci, aberrations in metaphase telomeres, and a loss of histone H3 trimethyl K9 and origin recognition complex (ORC) binding at telomere repeat DNA.

SMG proteins (effectors of nonsense-mediated decay) are enriched at telomeres in vivo and negatively regulate TERRA association with chromatin, protecting chromosome ends from telomere loss (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17916692"">Azzalin (2007)</a>).

TERRA transcripts inhibit telomerase activity in vitro, therefore suggested to negatively regulate telomere length. Consistent with this hypothesis, TERRA knock-down causes a loss of telomeric DNA repeats.

TERRA transcripts have recently been detected associated with heterochromatin marks typical of telemores (histone H3 trimethyl K9) as well as with different telomere proteins, including telomere repeat factors 1 and 2 (TRF1 and TRF2), subunits of the ORC, heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), and members of the DNA-damage-sensing pathway.

122;Characteristics;"Spliced, polyadenylated, ~17kb in mice, ~19kb in humans.

Contains repeated sequence motifs A-F that are critical for its function.

Xist is located on the X chromosome in the X-inactivation center (Xic), an approximately 100-kb region in the mouse containing (as of June 2012) five other lncRNAs, many of which play crucial roles in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). 

Xist expression initiates the process of XCI in mammals.";1
122;Expression;"Xist is expressed in all somatic cells in female eutherian mammals, monoallelically from the inactive X-chromosome (Xi) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1985261"">Brown (1991)</a>). Xist is not expressed in males

Xist is a nuclear RNA that coats the Xi (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1423611"">Brown (1992)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8636206"">Clemson (1996)</a>). 

In the mouse, Xist expression is imprinted at specific times and places in development: Xist is transcribed exclusively from the paternally-inherited X (and thus the paternal X is always the Xi) only in the early pre-implantation blastocyst, and later in development only in extra-embryonic tissues such as the placenta.

Imprinted XCI in humans has not been demonstrated and may not exist (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20532033"">Moreira de Mello (2010)</a>).

In somatic tissues in mouse and human, XCI is random, not imprinted: either the paternal or maternal X can express Xist and become the Xi. This decision is made in each cell of the epiblast in the mouse, and the same X is inactivated in subsequent generations of daughter cells. Thus expression of Xist (and of nearly all X-linked genes) is mosaic, in the sense that each of the two alleles is active in different populations of cells.

Stage specific expression in different regions of developing mouse retina, with Tsix displaying a similar but weaker profile (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15226823"">Blackshaw (2004)</a>).

In female undifferentiated mouse ES (embryonic stem) and iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, Xist is not expressed and both X chromosomes are active. Differentiation of mouse ES cells results in the onset of Xist expression and XCI, and thus these cells are an important model system for the study of XCI.

In contrast, Xist expression and XCI are variable in female undifferentiated human ES cells (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339804"">Shen (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18339803"">Silva (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18340642"">Hall (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20471072"">Lengner (2010)</a>) and iPS cells (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21276761"">Bruck (2011)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19898493"">Hanna (2009)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21074045"">Marchetto (2010)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727844"">Tchieu (2010)</a>), which may reflect variability in the broader epigenetic states and developmental potential of these cells.";2
122;Function;"Xist is the master regulator of mammalian XCI, the mechanism of dosage compensation that balances X-linked gene expression between males and females.

Xist function is required to initiate XCI (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8538762"">Penny (1996)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9009199"">Marahrens (1997)</a>). Ectopic Xist expression from an autosomal transgene causes long-range gene repression in cis (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10882105"">Wutz (2000)</a>).

Xist and RepA (see associated components below) RNAs bind to and recruit PRC2, which catalyzes the deposition of the repressive chromatin mark H3K27me3 on the Xi (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974356"">Zhao (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21123648"">Kaneko (2010)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542000"">Kanhere (2010)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21172659"">Zhao (2010)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22659877"">Guil (2012)</a>).

Small RNAs formed from Xist/Tsix duplexes may play a role in regulating Xist expression and XCI (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18535243"">Ogawa (2008)</a>). However, loss of Dicer has only a modest effect on Xist expression (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19164542"">Kanellopoulou (2009)</a>), contrary to what would be expected if RNAi is a major regulator of XCI.

hnRNP U (also known as SP120 or SAF-A) binds Xist through its RGG domain while the SAF domain is also required for localisation to the Xi. hnRNP U is required for both Xist localisation to the Xi and the initation of X-inactivation (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20833368"">Hasegawa (2010)</a>.

Xist Repeat C sequences are required for Xist localization to the Xi (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11481485"">Beletskii (2001)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21135235"">Sarma (2010)</a>).

YY1 can interact with several DNA binding sites within exon 1 of Xist, and also to the repeat C (and perhaps repeat B) RNA sequences of the Xist transcript. Thus YY1 tethers Xist RNAs to the Xi and nucleates the Xist cloud that coats the Xi (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21729784"">Jeon (2011)</a>).

Xist forms a transcriptionally silenced sub-nuclear domain (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16912274"">Chaumeil (2006)</a>) and perinucleolar localisation of the silent Xist coated chromosome has been observed (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17512404"">Zhang (2007)</a>). The A region repeats are essential for the recruitment of late inactivated X genes to the silencing compartment and for the recruitment of the silencing complex PRC2 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20052282"">Maenner (2010)</a>).

After the initiation of XCI, Xist function is not absolutely required to maintain XCI in fibroblasts (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10431231"">Csankovszki (1999)</a>). Nor is continued Xist expression required to maintain XCI-like repression around an autosomal Xist transgene in male, differentiated ES cells (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10882105"">Wutz (2000)</a>). However, lack of Xist function in differentiated cells can lead to partial reactivation of select X-linked genes (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11352938"">Csankovszki (2001)</a>).";3
122;Conservation;"Xist is present in all eutherian (placental) mammals examined to date, but it is not present in marsupials or monotremes (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16778056"">Duret (2006)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17333538"">Davidow (2007)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17333539"">Hore (2007)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17333537"">Shevchenko (2007)</a>).

Y RNAs form characteristic stem-loop structures, with a highly conserved double-stranded stem formed by partially complementary 5' and 3' terminal domains, linked by a loop domain containing secondary stem-loops (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10606662"">Teunissen (2000)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7688474"">O'Brien (1993)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8041611"">van Gelder (1994)</a>). Parts of the RNA structure appear to be flexible, able to adopt different conformations. Y RNAs contain an essential characteristic bulged C in the middle portion of the stem  (in position 8 or 9), as well as the characteristic pyrimidine-rich region that is single-stranded in the secondary structures (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10606662"">Teunissen (2000)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9671049"">Green (1998)</a>).";1

Ectopic expression of VL30-1 RNA in a human tumor cell promoted metastasis (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11959915"">Song (2002)</a>), and in mice over-expression of VL30-1 RNA promoted cell proliferation in culture and tumorigenesis in-vivo (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19805375"">Wang (2009)</a>).

VL30-1 RNA is tumor-promoting whereas PSF is a tumor-suppressor agent, and the molar ratio of PSF protein and VL30-1 RNA regulates proto-oncogene transcription, cell proliferation, and tumorigenesis. VL30-1 RNA binds and releases PSF from a proto-oncogene and activates transcription of target genes (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079199"">Song (2005)</a>). For example, in mice VL30-1 RNA has been shown to bind and release PSF from the proto-oncogene Rab23, activating its transcription in-trans (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19805375"">Wang (2009)</a>). (Although VL30 RNAs are not present in the human genome, a similar regulatory mechanism functions in human cells, in which different RNA fragments bind PSF (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19625619"">Li (2009)</a>).)

VL30 is enriched in multiple stem cell populations and may have roles in determining  ""stemness"", or stem cell function (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14651920"">Easterday (2003)</a>).";3

144;Characteristics;"In mouse, LXRBSV is an alternative splicing isoform of LXR-beta that has a 270bp intronic sequence retained between exons 4 and 5 (or exons 2 and 3 depending on LXR-beta isoform).

Quantitative expression and promoter reporter assays indicated that LXRBSV is preferentially transcribed and expressed in the pituitary. LXRBSV expression in the whole brain and especially in the pituitary was significantly higher compared to that in the liver. This is in contrast to LXR-beta mRNA that showed similar expression in the liver and brain and significantly reduced expression in the pituitary and hypothalamus compared to liver (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20211147"">Hashimoto (2010)</a>).";2
144;Function;"LXRBSV acts as a specific transcriptional co-activator for LXR-beta to enhance its receptor-mediated transactivation. LXRBSV synergistically augmented ligand-dependent activation of the SREBP-1c promoter (Sterol Response Element Binding Protein-1c promoter), but not of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and peroxidase proliferator and activating receptors (PPARs).

The intronic sequence inserted into LXRBSV is required for its transactivation activity.

LXRBSV protein was deduced to be 64 amino acids in length, but different evidence demonstrated that the alternative splicing transcript acts as a RNA co-activator: 1) a GAL4-LXRBSV fusion protein was not able to induce transactivation; 2) an ATG mutant of LXRBSV was able to induce transactivation as wild type, and 3) LXRBSV functions in the presence of cycloheximide (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19878653"">Hashimoto (2009)</a>).";3

Riboprobe Northern blot indicates the existence of three additional Emx2os splicing isoforms differentially detected in the murine urogenital system, with sizes of 6.0, 2,3 and 1,8 kb, which are supported by cDNA evidence (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12573261"">Noonan (2003)</a>).";1

Emx2os is expressed in the developing mouse CNS. Examination of expression at E10.5, E12.5, E14.5 and E18.5 showed, similar to Emx2, that its levels reduce progressively from E10.5 to E18.5. At E12.5, it is detected in a number of CNS structures also expressing Emx2 mRNA, such as the pallium and basal ganglia, mammillary recess of the hypothalamus, optic tectum, olfactory placode and otic vesicle. Emx2os is found in the developing telencephalon in periventricular proliferative layers and the cortical plate (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053"">Spigoni (2010)</a>).

However, the sense/antisense pair may also show mutually exclusive patterns, such as within the cortex. Emx2os is detected in periventricular precursors that also express Emx2, but peaks in newly born post-mitotic neurons, which do not express Emx2, whereas Emx2 is expressed Cajal-Retzius neurons lying in the marginal zone, which do not express the antisense RNA (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053"">Spigoni (2010)</a>).

In vitro knock-down experiments indicate that Emx2os contributes to post-transcriptional down-regulation of its sense partner in cortical precursors and their neuronal progenies, possibly by a Dicer1-dependent process  (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053"">Spigoni (2010)</a>).

However, ectopic expression of a 5' fragment (OS1-179+) of Emx2os in neural precursors of the rhombo-spinal tract stimulates expression of Emx2, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism, perhaps at transcriptional level. In addition, Emx2 knock-out results in a strong reduction of Emx2os transcript levels, indicating a possible reciprocal regulatory loop (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20066053"">Spigoni (2010)</a>).";3

174;Function;"SRG1 inhibits transcription of SER3 by transcriptional interference, as the process of SRG1 transcription through the SER3 promoter prevents transcription factor binding to this locus (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15175754"">Martens (2004)</a>). SRG1 transcription does not appear to be sufficient for repression with proper chromatin remodeling also required (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16484372"">Davis (2006)</a>). 

SER3 is an enzyme involved in serine biosynthesis, whose expression is regulated by the level of serine. Serine level controlled the expression of SRG1, with SRG1 transcribed when serine is present and repressed when it is not. This regulation depended on Cha4, a serine dependent regulator, which binds the SRG1 promoter. When serine is high Cha4 appears to recruit the SAGA and Swi/Snf complexes to SRG1 promoter to activate SRG1 expression and repress SER3 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16291644"">Martens (2005)</a>).";4

175;Function;"Summary:
Controls activation of 5’ HOXA genes. Chromosomal lopping bring it into close association with 5’ gene loci.

- HOTTIP controls activation of 5’ HOXA genes in mammals and chicken. 
- Impact on HOXA genes decreases with increased genomic distance from HOTTIP.
- Phenotypic impact in chicken forelimb of HOTTIP knockdown was shorter than normal distal bones. 

- HOTTIP doesn’t affect chromosomal structure and looping but it was necessary for maintenance of H3 K4me3 chromatin marks over the distally expressed 5’ half of the HOXA locus. HOTTIP RNA binds WDR5 a component of MLL/Trithorax complexes recruiting a MLL complex to lay down H3 K4me3 marks.
- WDR5 binding mediated by sequence(s) in 5’ 1kb of HOTTIP.

184;Name;"snaR: small NF90-associated RNAs";0
184;Characteristics;"~117nt. RNA polymerase III transcripts. Highly structured. snaR genes shares sequence identity with Alu RNA and two potential piRNAs. Cloned snaR sequences have a run of adenines in the 3' end followed by a run of thymidines (which presumably constitute the PolIII termination site) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395"">Parrott (2007)</a>).

snaR-A and snaR-B were originally identified associated to the Nuclear factor 90 (NF90) (a double-stranded RNA-binding protein implicated in multiple cellular functions) by in vivo cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation.RNA species immunoprecipitated with NF90 were ~80–120 nt long (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17913627"">Parrott (2007)</a>). Several related RNAs of ~104 nt were originally cloned and identified, with snaR-A being the major component, and snaR-B representing the minor subset.  snaR-A and snaR-B are ~90% identical in sequence. Human genomic sequences corresponding to snaR-A and snaR-B have occasional mismatches (suggested to be possibly due to C-to-U editing of the RNA).

snaR genes occur in multiple copies (accumulated by segmental duplication) arranged in two inverted regions of tandem repeats on human chromosome 19. Additional snaR gene copies are present, with two of them adjacent to genes encoding the beta chain of chorionic gonadotropin:

In total, 28 snaR genes have been identified in the human genome, including 14 genes for snaR-A and 2 genes for snaR-B. snaR genes identified by sequence analysis include 5 snaR-C genes and additional genes (snaR-D, -E, -F, -G1, -G2, -H, -I, -12 and -21) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395"">Parrott (2007)</a>). snaR-D to -G include 5 unique genes on chromosome 19 as well as single copies (snaR-2 and -3) on chromosomes 2 and 3. snaR-G1 and -G2 are located in a gene-rich 2.1 Mb genomic fragment between the two clusters, lying within the promoter region of two genes encoding the beta polypeptide of chorionic gonadotropin (CG-beta) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395"">Parrott (2007)</a>).";1
184;Expression;"Predominantly cytoplasmic, unstable (half-life of ~15 min in HeLa cells), expressed in diverse cell lines and human tissues. The different snaR genes have different expression levels and profiles, and, among more than 20 adult human tissues analysed, snaR transcripts are found particularly abundant in testis, with low levels detected in brain, placenta and some other organs. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395"">Parrott (2007)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053"">Parrott (2010)</a>).

Highly abundant in some cells, with snaR-A estimated in ~70,000 copies in a HEK293T cell (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395"">Parrott (2007)</a>).

snaR-A and snaR-G2 are differentially expressed in discrete regions of the human brain and other tissues, such as testis (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053"">Parrott (2010)</a>). snaR-A was expression n testis was ~100-fold higher than in term placenta, lung and adipose tissue, and in brain its levels were ~10% of the testis level in three of four segments of pituitary gland, with substantial expression also observed in other brain regions (such as hypothalamus, globus pallidus and thalamus) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053"">Parrott (2010)</a>). snaR-G2 levels in adult brain were ~55% of that in testis (highest in caudate/accumbens/putamen and globus pallidus), and several tissues displayed 5–15% of testis levels. Fetal brain contained much less snaR-G2 than adult brain (~3% of testis level), suggestive of developmental regulation. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053"">Parrott (2010)</a>)

snaR-A is up-regulated in transformed and immortalized human cells (Parrott et al. 2010).";2
184;Function;"Functions of snaR transcripts have not been identified yet.

snaR transcripts interact with NF90's double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395"">Parrott (2007)</a>), and snaR-A is also found stably bound to ribosomes in HeLa cells (Parrott et al. 2010).

184;Conservation;"snaR genes are present exclusively in African Great Apes and some are unique to humans. Human snaR-A has orthologs in chimpanzee but not rhesus macaque or mouse. Chimpanzee has fewer snaR genes than humans (10 instead of 28). snaRs appear to have undergone accelerated evolution (snaR genes display a lower degree of homology within the gene than in their flanking sequence) and differential expansion in the great apes.  (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395"">Parrott (2007)</a>, Parrott et al. 2010). There are ~17 nt changes between human snaR-A (121nt) and snaR-C  (119nt) species (~14% difference), compared to an average substitution rate of ~3.7?nt per 120nt (~3% difference) outside of the snaR locus (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053"">Parrott (2010)</a>).

The single snaR gene on chimpanzee chromosome 2a is 94% identical with its ortholog on human chromosome 2, and two genes on chimpanzee chromosome 19 are orthologous with snaR-G1 (a unique gene on human chromosome 19). The position of these snaR genes relative to the primate-specific CG-beta genes is conserved. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855395"">Parrott (2007)</a>)";4
184;Misc;"*Two families of snaR-related genetic elements were identified in primates: CAS (catarrhine ancestor of snaR), limited to Old World Monkeys and apes; and ASR  (Alu/snaR-related), present in all monkeys and apes. These two classes appear to have spread by retrotransposition.
It has been proposed that snaR genes evolved through a series of internal deletions and expansions  from the left monomer of the primate-specific Alu SINE family via ASR and CAS (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20935053"">Parrott (2010)</a>).

RNAP II was recently found to bind near 7SK promoter, as well as many other known Pol III genes, suggesting that RNAP II may also play a role in regulating their transcription (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20139302"">Raha (2010)</a>).

*In invertebrates, 7SK homologs may have different sizes (such as >400 nt and ~130 nt in drosophilids and nematodes, respectively). (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18566019"">Gruber (2008)</a>) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19734296"">Marz (2009)</a>)";1

7SK snRNA is a central scaffold that coordinates protein-protein interactions and, by inhibiting P-TEFb kinase-mediated CTD phosphorylation, regulates RNAP II elongation (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11713533"">Nguyen (2001)</a>). 7SK snRNP (composed of 7SK snRNA, Hexim1, Larp7/Pip7S, and the P-TEFb subunits CycT1 and Cdk9) is not only critical for controlling transcription, but also for regulating alternative splicing coupled to transcription elongation (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416841"">Barboric (2009)</a>). It is also essential for vertebrate development (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416841"">Barboric (2009)</a>). The 3' end of HIC mRNA has full activity and contains a predicted structure resembling the 3'-terminal hairpin of 7SK that is critical for P-TEFb binding (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416841"">Barboric (2009)</a>).

7SK has been found highly enriched in isolated chromatin fractions, which may be related to its role in transcriptional regulation (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20404130"">Mondal (2010)</a>).

At an early stage of the HIV transcription cycle, elongation is prevented as P-TEFb is recruited to the HIV-1 promoter in a catalytically inactive state bound to the 7SK snRNP and also the Tat trans-activator of transcription protein. The inhibitory 7SK snRNP may be displaced by the nascent TAR HIV RNA that also binds Tat protein, activating P-TEFb kinase and transcriptional elongation (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562857"">D'Orso (2010)</a>). Displacement of 7SK may also be performed by cellular RNAs, as indicated by the 3'-untranslated region (~300-nt) of HIC mRNA, which forms complexes with P-TEFb and is necessary and sufficient for stimulation of P-TEFb-dependent transcription of the HIV promoter (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17925858"">Young (2007)</a>).

7SK RNA also inhibits APOBEC3C deaminase activity and sequesters it to the nucleolus, suggesting broader role for 7SK RNA in regulating key nuclear functions (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17381310"">He (2006)</a>).";3

A microarray analysis of D. discoideum cells infected with Legionella pneumophila indicated down-regulation of dutA mRNA, suggesting a possible function of dutA in host–pathogen interaction (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469056"">Farbrother (2006)</a>).";2

However, over-expression of dutA segments suppresses mutations in the signaling component Dd-STATa (the functional homolog of metazoan STAT transcriptional factors), rescuing stalk formation that is impaired in the mutants and indicating an inhibitory role of dutA in culmination.

195;"Biological background";"Ciliated protozoa contain two nuclei, a germline nucleus and a somatic nucleus.
- The somatic nucleus is active but not passed on after fertilization.
- The germline nucleus is transcriptionally inert in the mother cell but is transmitted to progeny. The new somatic nucleus is created from this germline nucleus (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799"">Nowacki (2009)</a>).

In Paramecium tetraurelia creating the new somatic nucleus requires widespread deletion of repetitive sequences and tens of thousands of internal eliminated sequences (IES) to create the compact somatic nucleus in the progeny (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799"">Nowacki (2009)</a>).

Elimination of DNA appears to depend on whether it was present in the maternal somatic nucleus, with DNA present in the maternal somatic nucleus being retained in the progeny somatic nucleus. This process appears to be controlled by interactions between homologous short and long noncoding RNAs (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799"">Nowacki (2009)</a>).
";1
195;"Characteristics & Expression";"DNA in the somatic nucleus is transcribed into sense and antisense noncoding RNAs during both vegetative growth and sexual reproduction (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519642"">Lepère (2008)</a>).";2
195;Function;"RNA transcripts derived from DNA sequences in the maternal somatic nucleus are necessary but not necessarily sufficient to cause retention of this sequence in the progeny somatic nucleus (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519642"">Lepère (2008)</a>).

For example: introduction of an IE sequence into the maternal somatic nucleus is able to maintain the presence of that IES in the somatic nucleus of the progeny in some cases (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7649484"">Duharcourt (1995)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9819394"">Duharcourt (1998)</a>).
However degradation of IES RNA transcripts during the vegetal growth stage prevented maintenance of that IES in progeny somatic nuclei, showing long noncoding transcripts from the maternal somatic nuclei were necessary for maintenance of the DNA in progeny (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519642"">Lepère (2008)</a>).

Paramecium expresses a complex population of ~25 nuc germline Scan RNAs (scnRNAs) during early meiosis which have homology to all types of germline sequences. Knockdown of scnRNAs allows retention of sequences normally deleted from the progeny somatic nucleus (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19103667"">Lepère (2009)</a>).

ScnRNA : Maternal ncRNA model 
ScnRNAs signal sequences to be deleted while maternal RNAs signal sequences to be maintained. Hypothesised that maternal somatic RNAs deplete homologous germline scnRNAs, preventing excision of these sequences in progeny somatic nuclei. Whereas undepleted scnRNAs do cause excision of target DNA sequences (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18519642"">Lepère (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19103667"">Lepère (2009)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19879799"">Nowacki (2009)</a>).

EBERs can be secreted from EBV-infected cells and can be detected in the sera of infected patients.

Functionality of EBER1 and 2 does not appear to be redundant, as transforming capacity of EBER2-deleted virus is comparable to that of EBV lacking both EBERs, but that of EBER-1-deleted virus is as high as wild-type EBV, indicating that EBER1 does not play a critical role in EBV-induced B-cell growth transformation.

Sox2dot isoform is expressed at very low levels in undifferentiated neurospheres, but with a marked increase in the more differentiated neurospheres.

In situ hybridization analysis of mouse brain sections of Sox2ot and Sox2dot expression detected both transcripts in zones of adult neurogenesis, such as the subventricular zone, rostral migratory stream and olfactory bulb (where Sox2dot is most highly expressed) (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18184812"">Mercer (2008)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19767420"">Amaral (2009)</a>).

Many Sox2ot isoforms are present in whole embryo and newborn mouse. In adult mouse, different isoforms are detected primarily in brain, but also at lower levels in tissues where Sox2 is detected, such as lung, or not detected, such as testis. In adult tissues, Sox2dot was only detected in brain.

Highly enriched binding of neuronal transcriptional repressor NRSF/REST has been found in conserved sites upstream of Sox2ot.

Sox2ot is dynamically regulated during chicken and zebrafish embryogenesis, consistently associated with central nervous system structures, including fish embryo eyes, but also mesoderm tissues. During chicken development, increasing levels ofSox2ot were observed after 2days of embryonic development, similar to the pattern observed for Sox2, although with lower absolute expression levels. Expression of both Sox2 and Sox2ot was enriched to the head of 6.5-d chicken embryos, compared to the limbs and whole body. In fish, sox2 and sox2ot presented concordant up-regulation after the sphere stage, suggesting that both are early zygotic genes, but their expression patterns diverged after the tailbud stage when sox2ot total levels decreased. Sox2dot is expressed at very low levels in early embryos, but is dramatically induced at 5 dpf.

In humans, qRT-PCR analysis showed that SOX2OT is highly enriched in the brain, where SOX2 is also predominantly expressed, but also detected in other tissues such as testis.

Expression of ICR1 is repressed by PWR1 (again probably by promoter occlusion in cis), allowing expression of FLO11, so the regulatory circuit depends on whether PWR1 is expressed or repressed.

ICR1 is lowly expressed constitutively and competition between Flo8 and Sfl1 transcription factors determines which ncRNA is expressed and therefore if FLO11 is on or off.";3

239;Function;"Overexpression of npc48 in Arabidopsis thaliana led to strong leaf serration (a symptom of defects in cell proliferation along the margins of leaf primordia). Plants overexpressing npc48 showed other drastic developmental anomalies, including an increase in the rosette diameter and a delay in flowering time compared with wild-type plants.

The phenotype of npc48-over-expressing plants resembles that of plants over-expressing MIR168, which have reduced levels of the miR168 AGO1 target, and of AGO1-sensitive miRNAs such as miR166. They also show decreased miR166 accumulation, but presence of AGO1 mRNA and miR168 at wild-type levels.

In addition, npc48 plants exhibited reduced accumulation of miR164, suggesting that npc48 could regulate a subset of miRNAs. Interestingly, mir164a mutants also display abnormal serrations of the leaf margins, which are milder than the serrations induced by overexpression of npc48, suggesting that the reduction in miR164 alone cannot account for the phenotype.

Over-expression of npc48 did not have a general effect on miRNAs or AGO1 accumulation (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18997003"">Ben Amor (2009)</a>).";3

- GAL10 transcription also causes a decrease in some histone 3 acetlyation.

GAL10 ncRNA acts in cis, recruiting the Rpd3S HDAC complex. Unknown if GAL10 ncRNA can physically recruit any chromatin modifying complexes or if transcription dependent chromatin changes independent of the GAL10-ncRNA sequence are responsible.

262;Function;"First lncRNA identified as a miRNA target (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964070"">Hansen (2011)</a>).

Function in association with miR-7:
CDR1 AS acts as a sponge for miR-7, which can bind to CDR1 AS but not degrade it (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446348"">Memczak (2013)</a>). 
CDR1 AS shows high levels of miR-7 and Ago2 association, which causes co-localisation of CDR1 AS to P-bodies (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446348"">Memczak (2013)</a>).
CDR1 AS and miR-7 expression patterns are not identical. However co-expression in the same brain cells can be identified in the dentate hilus and different layers of the cingulate gyrus (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>). The lack of CDR1 AS expression outside the brain makes it possible this is a brain specific interaction and function.
CDR1 AS inhibit miR-7 activity causing depression of some miR-7 targets (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446348"">Memczak (2013)</a>).
Expression of human or mouse circular CDR1 AS in developing zebrafish (which have miR-7 but not the CDR1 locus) caused a decrease in midbrain size. This closely mimicked the phenotype of miR-7 knockdown, further supporting CDR1 AS as a biologically relevant miR-7 sponge (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446348"">Memczak (2013)</a>).  


Function in association with miR-671: 
CDR1 AS functions to stabilize CDR1 mRNA, as a decrease in CDR1 AS levels leads to a decrease in the expression level of the sense CDR1 mRNA. Conversely, the sense transcript does not act to stabilize the antisense lncRNA and appears to destabilize it, perhaps through a feedback mechanism (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964070"">Hansen (2011)</a>).
CDR1 AS and hence CDR1 sense are regulated by miR-671. A conserved miR-671 binding site is present in the antisense transcript (a site which corresponds to near the transcriptional start site of the sense CDR1 mRNA). miR-671 localises to the nucleus and can repress CDR1 AS and CDR1 sense mRNA (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964070"">Hansen (2011)</a>).
miR-671 causes Ago2 mediated cleavage and down-regulation of CDR1 AS, likely due to the near perfect complementarity between miR-671 and CDR1 AS (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964070"">Hansen (2011)</a>).
Mechanism for how CDR1 AS stabilizes CDR1 is not certain but it does not appear to be due to the lncRNA acting as a miR-671 sponge (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964070"">Hansen (2011)</a>).
By down-regulating CDR1 AS miR-671 could potentially indirectly regulate miR-7 and hence the levels of miR-7 target genes (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>).";3
262;Conservation;"CDR1 AS found in eutherian mammals (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21964070"">Hansen (2011)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>).

miR-7 targets sites are conserved in eutherian mammals (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>), with 63 present in a least one other species (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446348"">Memczak (2013)</a>).";4

Mira mediated a local rearrangement in chromatin structure to bring the Mira, Hox66 and Hoxa7 loci into a complex providing a mechanism for MLL1 to act on HoxA6/A7 after recruitment to the Mira locus.

Mira bound to the SET domain of MLL1 through a short hairpin (activator binding motif, ABM) near the 3’ end of the RNA. In vitro binding studies suggested MLL1 recruitment was mediated by Mira forming a RNA/DNA hybrid with a protruding ssRNA 3’ end containing the ABM. ";3

278;Function;"LncRNA regulates gene expression through SNAI1 dependant and independent mechanisms. 

Stimulates SNAI1 gene expression (in A549 cells) and like SNAI1 is required for cell migration.

Stimulates Aurora-kinase A (AURKA) expression, a gene found ~6 megabases from LOC100887755 on chr20. SNAI1 does not appear to regulate AURKA and so LOC100887755 appears to regulate AURKA by a SNAI1 independent mechanism.";3
279;Characteristics;"Three exon transcript. Contains miR-206 in second intron and miR-133b in third and final exon. Has binding sites for miR-135 in exon2 and miR-133 in exon 3. This structure is conserved in mouse and humans.

Shows evidence of alternative splicing of exon 2 in mouse. This alternative isoform no longer contains the miR-135 binding sites. Functional characterization was on the standard isoform containing the miRNA recognition sequences.

PolyA+";1
279;Expression;"Expression induced during myoblast differentiation but absent in proliferating myoblasts in mouse and humans.

In mouse tissues expression was restricted to certain skeletal muscles where it was found only in ""newly regenerating fibres"". Expression is found more widely found amongst skeletal muscle of mutant mice which do not express dystrophin. 

Conversely in myoblasts from humans with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), there was little linc-MD1 expression and MYOG and MHC expression was also reduced.  

Predominately cytoplasmic.

Promoter regions near the linc-MD1 and miR-206 TSSs contain conserved CANNTG (E-box) sequences, and are bound by the muscle transcription factor MyoD. During myoblast differentiation and in muscles where linc-MD1 is expressed these promoter regions (plus others) form long distance chromatin interactions.";2
279;Function;"Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Binds miR-135 and miR-133 and inhibits their repressive action, including on MEF2C and MAML1, two transcription factors required for proper muscle differentiation.

linc-MD1 required for normal up-regulation of MYOG, MHC and MCK genes during myoblast differentiation. 

Nb: These linc-MD1 effects were also observed when linc-MD1 was mutated so miR-133b could not be released from the sequence, showing this effect was due to the lincRNA transcript. ";3
279;Conservation;"Exon 1 and the region of exon 3 containing miR-133b is conserved in mammals and also back to chicken. Exon 2 conserved in mammals.";4
279;Misc;"Expression of miR-206 and miR-133b is specific to muscle tissue. miR-133b expression profile closely corresponds to that of linc-MD1.

280;Characteristics;"Antisense to SUR7 coding gene. SUT719 comes from a bidirectional promoter with GAL80 where they share regulatory signals. The 3' end of SUT719 extends through and beyond the SUR7 transcription start site.  ";1
280;Expression;"SUT719 and SUR7 are both expressed in standard galactose media. Upon stimulation with alpha-factor pheromone SUR7 is switched off while SUT719 continues to be expressed.

SUT719 expression is regulated by Gal4 (as is the expression of GAL80, which shares a bidirectional promoter with SUT719).";2
280;Function;"SUT719 is required for complete switching off of SUR7 expression (disruption of SUT719 expression allows SUR7 expression after stimulation with alpha-factor pheromone when it would normally not be expressed).

SUT719 acts to fine tune gene expression by impacting the on/off threshold of SUR7. When SUR7 is expressed at low levels it is inhibited by SUT719, but high level SUR7 gene expression is not affected by SUT719.";3
280;Misc;"Regulation of GAL80 gene expression also affects SUT719, as they both come from a bidirectional promoter. In turn, SUT719 can regulate the expression of SUR7. This demonstrates a model whereby neighbouring coding genes regulate each other via ncRNA expression/ regulation and also a mechanism for spreading a regulatory signal (ie: that imposed on GAL80) along a chromosome.";5

281;Characteristics;"Several lncRNA transcripts, alpha, beta and unspliced, expressed antisense to <a href=""http://www.lncrnadb.org/Detail.aspx?TKeyID=187"">PTENP1 pseudogene</a> (also known as PTENpg1)

Alpha and beta isoforms are, at least, four exon transcripts that differ in the position of the transcription start site (TSS). Alpha isoform initiates 5' and so has a longer first exon.

Unspliced isoform initiates transcription from alpha TSS.

Spliced transcripts show evidence of alternative splicing of exon 3.";1
281;Expression;"Alpha and beta spliced isoforms found predominately in cytoplasm and polyA +. Unspliced alpha isoform was predominately in nucleus and polyA-.

Expression of PTENP1 asRNAs negatively correlates with expression of PTEN coding gene and positively correlates with PTENP1 sense pseudogene expression. Combined, the PTENP1 asRNAs generally showed higher expression than the sense PTENP1 pseudogene.

AsRNAs expressed in a number of cell lines including HEK293T, U2OS, A375 and DU145.";2
281;Function;"PTENP1 asRNA alpha:
Inhibits transcription of the PTEN coding gene (knockdown caused up-regulation of PTEN, while asRNA alpha overexpression inhibited PTEN mRNA levels). 

PTENP1 asRNA alpha acts in trans by localising to the PTEN coding gene promoter and inhibiting expression. Repression of PTEN by PTENP1 asRNA alpha also involves EZH2 and DNMT3A. PTENP1 asRNA alpha binds DNMT3A (DNA methylase) and is required for the deposition of repressive H3K27me3 chromatin marks at the PTEN promoter.

PTENP1 asRNA alpha regulation of PTEN is functionally significant. Loss of asRNA alpha leads to increased PTEN and p21 protein levels, negatively regulating the cell cycle and also sensitizing cells to apoptosis.

PTENP1 asRNA beta:
PTENP1 asRNA beta isoform forms an RNA-RNA interaction with PTENP1 sense and stabilizes it. This interaction promotes the function of PTENP1 sense as a positive regulator of PTEN mRNA levels, potentially by allowing the export of PTENP1 sense to the cytoplasm.

Summary:
PTENP1 asRNA alpha and beta have different functions. Alpha negatively regulating PTEN transcription and beta positively regulating PTEN mRNA post-transcriptionally through PTENP1 sense. 
Sense and antisense transcrips from PTEN pseduogene regulate both transcription and translation of PTEN.";3

282;Characteristics;"Sry is the male determining gene in mammals. Trigger testis formation. Member of the SOX gene family and known to encode a protein. For review see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22964823"">Sekido (2013)</a>.

In mouse, Sry has long inverted repeats on either side of the Sry ORF. Transcriptional initiation within the 5' repeat extending through to the 3' repeat allows the formation of a stem loop structure, which promotes circularisation of the transcript. Transcription that starts after the 5' repeat gives rise to a linear Sry transcript <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8566785"">Dubin (1995)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9369180"">Dolci (1997)</a>, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22964823"">Sekido (2013)</a>.";1

282;Function;"Circular mouse Sry has 16 putative targets sites for miR-138 (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>).

Circular mouse Sry appears able to interact with miR-138 and Ago2 acting as a microRNA sponge and potentially inhibiting the effects of miR-138 on other transcripts (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23446346"">Hansen (2013)</a>). Though the in-vivo impact of this action is not yet clear.

Sry appear to be a bi-functional gene with both protein coding and RNA functionality.";3
282;Conservation;"A circular Sry RNA has only identified in mouse and appears due to species specific long inverted repeats in the mouse Sry gene.";4
